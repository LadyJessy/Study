//Create a function where you calculate the price of a single ticket to the movie THE BATMAN
//Preconditions: The total cost was 27 and 3 people are going to the movies


//First variant

function TicketPrice(Total_price, Number_of_People){
  console.log(`Your ticket price is ${Total_price/Number_of_People}`);
}

TicketPrice(); //Here we are not passing parameters so the output will be "Your ticket price is NaN"

TicketPrice(27,3); //We can pass the values we want. Now when we call this function the message "Your ticket price is 9" will appear


//Second variant

function TicketPrice (Total_price = 27, Number_of_People = 3){
  console.log('Your ticket price is ' + Total_price/Number_of_People);
}

TicketPrice(); //In this variant we don't assign parameters and we assume that the total price and number of people have default values, less flexible approach

//Third variant - pretty much the same that those above, except we assign the resulting value to the variable MyTicket.


function TicketPrice(Total_price, Number_of_People){
  return Total_price/Number_of_People;
}

const MyTicket = TicketPrice(27,3);

console.log(`Your ticket price is ${MyTicket}`);
